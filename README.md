# Business Site

## The Hotel Business Site

This business started out as a Team Project at Technigo Web Development Boot Camp, but was then developed further by me personally. The task was to create a business one-pager website containing an image or video-hero, as well as a signup form with main focus to practice HTML forms and working with images in CSS. During the teamwork part of the project, mob-programming was used. 

## Process and problems

We started out by using Figjam and Figma to sketch a design. VScode with "Live Share" was used to practice working as a team. We had a problem with the first push. This was solved by noticing that the terminal sent the information to the wrong repository. By adjusting the url this was solved.

During the team project many of us involved wished we had more time to work on the design, which in part is why this new Business Site made by me was created. An other part we wanted to develop further was making sure that the form required the check-in date to be before the check-out date for correct validation. Therefore a Javascript function creating this valitation was added. 

The hero image was also changed for a videohero, so that I could practise creating websites using video.
